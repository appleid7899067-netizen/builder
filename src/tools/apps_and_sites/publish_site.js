Call this only AFTER all requested files are finished and the progress checklist is complete; do not open the preview midway through the build. The interface keeps the conversation visible while the assistant finishes and verifies the turn, then reveals the preview. This is NOT a public release: the user decides if and when to make the app public themselves, using the Publish button in the preview. Never make it public, call it "live"/"published", or share a public link.\n
Only files and folders contained within the hosted directory (its descendants) can be accessed through this preview URL. Any directories at the same level (siblings), directories above it (parents), or files in those directories are completely inaccessible — the hosted directory becomes an isolated root, and everything outside it is hidden and unreachable, as if it doesn't exist.\n
ABSOLUTELY VERY IMPORTANT: you only need to call this ONCE per app. The preview is connected to the directory and updates automatically when files change, so do NOT call it again on later edits.`,
