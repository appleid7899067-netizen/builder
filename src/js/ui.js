// from what was first observed), we reload the iframe. A timeout guarantees we
// always reload.

// share view: gradient check badge, social share row, the site rendered as a
// link-preview card (title/description/icon read from its own index.html), and
// Copy link / Visit site actions. Everything stays inside the panel — no
// blocking overlay — so publishing never interrupts the rest of the app; if
// the user closes the popover mid-publish, success reports via the toast
// instead. On FAILURE the body returns to the form (the typed address survives
// via _suggestedPublishName) and the existing alert flow takes over.

// Which body renderPublishPanel draws: the publish form (default), the
// in-flight progress note, or the post-publish share view. State-driven so the
// re-renders fired at turn boundaries (refreshPublishButton) keep the current
// view instead of snapping back to the form mid-publish.

// matches it. The window-identity check is the primary gate (only the real
// frame can be event.source, and comparing window refs does not throw across
// origins). The origin check is additive: when the expected origin is unknown
// (no current preview URL) or the message carries no comparable origin

// cannot see AND reports a healthy app as broken. Note this gates only JS errors

// --- In-turn preview verification ------------------------------------------
// After a build turn's changes reload the live preview, the update_preview tool
// calls window.verifyPreview to watch the freshly-loaded app for a short window
// and report any runtime errors back to the model, so it can fix them BEFORE
// finishing the turn — instead of handing the user a broken app and relying on
// the post-turn reactive auto-fix above. The two are complementary and never
// overlap: the reactive handlers act only when a turn is NOT running (they gate
// on !isProcessing), which is exactly when this in-turn path is inactive.
//
// Safety contract: verifyPreview is CONSERVATIVE — it reports errors ONLY when
// the freshly-reloaded document actually loaded and emitted them. A missing
// preview, a chat switch, an abort, or a load timeout all resolve to a benign
// non-error result, so a working app can never be wrongly flagged as broken
// (which would send the model rewriting healthy code).
